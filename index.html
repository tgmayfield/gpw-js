<h2>History</h2>
<p>
  This password generator is modeled after <a href="../multicians.html#Gasser" title="Multician: Contractor (MITRE): Multics Security Enhancements, password generator">Morrie Gasser's</a> original generator described in
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Gasser, M.,
    <cite>A Random Word Generator for Pronouncable Passwords</cite>,
    MTR-3006, The MITRE Corporation, Bedford, MA 01730,
    ESD-TR-75-97, HQ Electronic Systems Division, Hanscom AFB,
    MA 01731.
    NTIS AD A 017676.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  except that Morrie's used a second-order approximation to English and this generator uses a <b>third-order</b> approximation.
  A descendant of Gasser's generator was added to the <a href="../multics.html" title="Multics site home page">Multics</a> operating system by <a href="../mgg.html#Guardian" title="glossary: CISL/MITRE/USAF project that added AIM, the Access Isolation Mechanism,...">Project Guardian</a> in the mid 1970s,
  and I believe Digital's VMS added a similar feature in the 80s.
  FIPS Standard 181 describes a similar digraph-based generator, derived from Gasser's.
</p>
<p>
  [FIPS Standard 181 has been withdrawn without a replacement.
  Weaknesses in Gasser-like password generators were found in the 1990s.

  by Ravi Ganesan and Chris Davies.]
</p>

<p>
  The first digraph-based password generator I know of was written by <a href="../multicians.html#Edwards" title="Multician: System (MIT): CTSS, XRAY.">Daniel J. Edwards</a> about 1965
  for MIT's <a href="../thvv/7094.html" title="The IBM 7094 computer, and MIT Computation Center&#39;s CTSS timesharing system.">CTSS</a> timesharing system.
  Over the years I have implemented versions of this code in
  Multics PL/I, Tandem TAL, C/C++, Java, and JavaScript.
</p>
<p>
  The JavaScript code has also been packaged as an <a href="../thvv/gpwapp/index.html" title="iPhone version of password generator.">iPhone web app</a>.
  Visit the page using Safari on your iPhone, click the "box with an arrow" at the bottom of the screen, and click "add to home screen."
  A GPW icon will appear on your phone: clicking it will generate ten passwords and display a button to generate more.
  This web application will cache on your phone and can be used even without network connectivity.

  (21 Jan 2013)
  James Pearson used my JavaScript function to generate multi-word passphrases.
  An online demo is at <span class="cmd">https://changedmy.name/pronounceable-password-generator/</span>
  Source is on Github: <span class="cmd">https://github.com/xiongchiamiov/pronounceable-password-generator</span>
</p>
<p>
  (25 Jan 2016)
  I get mail occasionally from people that point out that some passwords are short.
  This can happen if the input dictionary contains some digraphs that only appear at the end of a word, such as "fy" and "qs".
  The algorithm gets "trapped."  You could generate your own dictionary with extra words to prevent this, if you think it is a problem.

  Tom Mayfield adapted this to work as a github page.

<h2>General</h2>
<p>
  The best way to use generated passwords is to modify them in ways known only to you.
  Make some letters capital, or insert punctuation and numbers, in order to use a larger alphabet.
  You could also generate two passwords and combine them.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Reusing passwords is very risky.</b>  Generate fresh ones for each need and store a list in an encrypted file.
  (Static or reusable passwords are obsolete.
  If you have a choice of authentication methods,
  look for a stronger method than passwords.)
